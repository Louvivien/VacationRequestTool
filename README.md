# React Authentication using Firebase

Reactjs authentication using firebase auth (using the new v9 API). The benefit of using this new API is that the final bundle size is much smaller compared to the previous - which in turn makes your React site efficient and load much faster.


The template is based on [ChakraUI](https://chakra-ui.com/) (incl. **Dark Mode**), though you can use any UI library you like but you need to do the relevant changes and keep the code related to firebase authentication - **the logic remains the same in any UI**.

## Prerequisite

Node version 16

brew install node@16

export NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider : this needs to be entered in the settings or the tool will not work make sure you have this




## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

_**Note**: Before running `npm start` do place the relevant environment variables in the `.env.local` file for firebase configuration._
